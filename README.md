# Throttle
A minimalistic React App that downloads the audio of YouTube videos,
converts it to mp3 and saves it in a selected location.

Uses react, electron, ytdl-core & ffmpeg plus materialize-css for styling.

This is my first React & Electron project and is quite hacky,
please excuse all the structuring mistakes and lack of best practices.

Use `npm run electron-dev` to launch React and Electron together.

Use `npm run dist` to build a distributable version.
